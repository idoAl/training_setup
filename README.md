# Setup for training

## So what are we going to set up?
* Ubuntu 18.04 working environment
* VMware player which is going to host our Ubuntu environment
* Make our environment remotely accessible to the windows host
  * Pycharm - Configure a remote interpreter using SSH
  

## Lets go!

There is a directory for every step.
Each one contains a README.md with instructions...

### 1. download ubuntu
check out the ubuntu directory!
### 2. download and install VMware Workstation Player

Check out the vmware directory!

* Note: if you have any problems, or you are too lazy to set
this up, check out the "clone a vm" section in the vmware README.

### 3. make our VM remotely accessible to the host
check out the remote access directory!.

If you have PyCharm community (which is the free version you probably have),
check out the samba directory and follow the instructions. 

### 4. install gcc
check out the gcc directory!
